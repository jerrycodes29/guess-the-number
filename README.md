# Guess The Number

* This application is a simple web game that challenges players to guess a random number between 1 and 30
* The game tracks the user's score, and shows a green screen if they successfully guess the number
* If the user runs out of score and is unable to guess the number, they will see a red screen with a lost message
* The game is built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* The project is a great way to practice and improve web development skills
* Special thanks to instructor Jonas Schmedtmann for his valuable guidance and assistance in creating the project.
